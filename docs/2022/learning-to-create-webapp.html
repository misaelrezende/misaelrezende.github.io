            My journey creating a web application using Django
        </h1>

        <p class="post-paragraphs">
            I study Information Systems at UFMG - Brazil. During mid term,
            I finally started to develop a web app that I've been planning
            for quite some time. I am vegan, and I find it difficult when I
            go shopping at the supermarket. I try to buy food from companies
            that do not explore animals, but gathering this information for
            every product can be time consuming and exhausting. So I found
            out that there is a vegan list on internet that is already
            comprised with a list of products made by manufacturers that do
            not exploit animals. However, I find it difficult to search for
            products on this list, because when I search on the vegan list,
            which is a pdf, I am getting results from the whole pdf, and content
            from product name, manufacturer name and product's note are within
            these results. Also, the results are scattered in different pages.
            Additionally, the list is not being constantly updated anymore, so I
            thought about helping simplifying the maintenance process too. I
            tried but couldn't find a web or mobile application that allows me
            to search for vegan products, so I thought that maybe one day I could
            help leverage a solution. I thought that a web application would be
            ideal to simplify the search for vegan products.            
        </p>
        <p class="post-paragraphs">
            First of all, this web app was originally meant to be a
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressive web application</a>
            (PWA). It was so, because I could mimic the usage as I'd do searching
            the pdf, that is, any user could search offline - by installing the PWA
            as an application. I did create a functional prototype, but it's been
            unmaintained for a while.
        </p>
        <p class="post-paragraphs">
            So at the end of my academic term, I decided not to go back to PWA
            development, and instead, I started to use Django. Some reasons that
            counted in favor are that Django provides an admin interface that
            enables fast addition/removals of content from the database, it is
            safe, scalable, it uses Python, and many other reasons. But this
            choice has cost me extra efforts. First of all, aside of PWA, I have
            never created a web application and I have never used Django, Flask
            or similar. So I had to learn Django by practicing, which I did by
            following Django official tutorial, then doing a small project by
            myself, to get more used to this tool.

        <p class="post-paragraphs special-message">
            Throughout this blog post series, I will detail about my experience
            creating this web app, along with a lot of questions I got myself
            into during the process.
        </p>
        <p class="post-paragraphs">
            When I started to plan all the fine details about my application,
            one of the first things I have worried about was how I would set
            Object Relational Model (ORM). That led me to some particularities
            from creating DB schemas to Django intrinsic functionalities. More
            information about this will be given on my second post. Then I
            started to think about how I would serve my web application. I had
            never deployed an application to the cloud, so I was completely lost.
            I'll talk more about it on a third post. Later on, I got myself
            wondering about how I would scale this web application? How I would
            enable concurrency? How many users would the application be able to
            serve. These questions led me to look for answers, that I'd share
            more in a fourth blog post.
